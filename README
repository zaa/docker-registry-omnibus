This is an Omnibus project that will build a "monolithic" OS package for Docker
Registry.  It installs an embedded version of python along with all python
packages required by the docker-registry project. This makes is possible to run
the Docker Registry without taking into account what version of the Python
Language or of the required packages is installed on the host system.
